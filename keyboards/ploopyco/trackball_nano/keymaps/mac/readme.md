# mac and windows compatible scrolling keymap
Mac keyboards do not share caps lock and num lock across all the plugged in keyboards so the technique used in the lkbm keymap does not work. Instead this keymap relies on the user having instaled Karabiner-Elements to make sure the caps lock is shared and multiplexes the caps lock to allow for the same controls. 

The keymap is as follows:
- Caps Lock x2: Scroll Lock 
- Caps Lock x4: DPI cycle
- Caps Lock x6: Bootloader mode


The time between presses is set to 200ms, to work with zsa keyboards.
